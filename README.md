## Information Architecture
The information on the page is organized into three primary sections to maximize clarity and navigability for users like Jordan. Using **Bootstrap**, I have structured a single-page layout that users can scroll or navigate through using a fixed header menu. Each section provides targeted information in a visually accessible way.

1. **About Me**: This section gives a concise introduction, featuring a profile picture, professional title, a brief biography, and social media links for connecting on platforms like LinkedIn. This top section allows the user to gain a quick overview of the candidate’s personality and background.

2. **Resume**: This central section, with sections for experience, education, skills, and languages, is formatted for easy scanning. Each subsection is neatly separated, with a download link for a full CV in PDF format. This setup allows recruiters to quickly grasp the candidate’s qualifications and credentials.

3. **Contact**: This final section provides contact details, inviting users to reach out via email or phone. By placing it last, it serves as a natural endpoint for those interested in further communication.

Overall, this layout facilitates quick access to each section, enhancing the user experience and making it easy to locate relevant information quickly.

## Visual Design
The visual design was crafted to communicate professionalism while ensuring readability and ease of navigation. **Bootstrap** was utilized to structure the layout, ensuring responsive, well-aligned components across devices and screen sizes. The color palette—featuring blues for accents and a light gray background—creates a clean and modern look that doesn’t distract from the content but subtly guides the user’s attention.

Typography choices include **Poppins** for body text, lending a readable and contemporary look, while **Roboto Mono** in headings creates a visual hierarchy that emphasizes section titles without overwhelming the viewer. Text size and spacing decisions were made to maximize readability, with clear separation between sections for a scannable structure. 

Buttons, links, and hover effects use Bootstrap’s color options, creating a seamless and polished interaction experience. A fixed top navigation bar was also implemented to make each section easily accessible without excessive scrolling. Visual feedback, such as hover effects on links and buttons, was added to make interactions intuitive and responsive. This visual design aligns with industry standards for professional portfolios, combining aesthetics with practicality.
